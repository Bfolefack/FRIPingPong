# Robot Learning Model to Play Ping Pong
#### Made through the Freshman Research Initiative's Robot Learning class under the supervision of Dr. Ben Abbatematteo
This semester, we attempted to create a robot learning model that enables a Sawyer robot to autonomously play ping pong against a human opponent. The ability of robots to engage in dynamic and interactive activities such as sports has significant implications for human-robot interaction and collaborative robotics. Our model aims to integrate machine learning algorithms with real-time sensory data processing and motor control strategies to facilitate adaptive game play. We developed multiple algorithms to detect a ball's position in space, a faithful simulation, and a reinforcement learning algorithm template.
